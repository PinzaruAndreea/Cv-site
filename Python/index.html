                <p> This was at the beginning of my learning. </p>
                <p>A programmer friend of mine instructed me that I should first start with Python to understand the logic behind these languages. </p>
                <p>And so I did, I followed the courses on codeacademy in Python, went through it all and then I learned about Data Structures and Algorithms through an Udemy course.</p>
                <p>The functions that I wrote in Python do some basic math calculations through the variables that are set at the beginning of the file.</p>

            <div class= "project_info inverted">
                <p>Throughout the online course I had taken at the time, I learned how to use functions in a more interactive way. </p>
                <p>For starters, one library had to be imported: random (randint-random integer). This will be used to place the battleship in a random place on the board.
                The board table was created by appending in a range of 5, 5 times of the string "o"</p>
                <p>I further defined five functions with the help of the imported library to set up the game. I nested a few statements in a for loop to decide what happens when a player gets the right spot of the battleship. </p>
                <p>A message will show if a person gets the shot right/misses it. </p>

            <p> This is about the end of the Python learning journey in codeacademy. After this project, I learned all about Data Structures and Algorithms. I will link those down below from my GitHub repo.</p>
            <p>This is a chatbot created through the utils library.
            I defined three functions, the first one for the coffee bot that takes the order, where I also created the drinks list and the entire script for the chatbot</p>
            <p>Then, I defined the order choices and the last function was for the special edition drink
            Lastly, I called the function. This was the project I enjoyed the most, because it was very interactive.</p>
